<!-- Here explain what the tech was used for this website! -->
<ul> 
<li>TailwindCSS: For a responsive website, this CSS framework gives <img style="height: 20px;" src="/public/weather-app.png">The Weather App a more flexible style for the content when users are visiting the app on a much smaller device than the browser on a computer</li>
<li>OpenWeatherMap: An open source service that provides weather data via API, <img style="height: 20px;" src="/public/weather-app.png">The Weather App captures all weather data from OpenWeatherMap</li>
</ul>
